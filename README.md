# Zipp Code App

Info: Zippcode app is pretty simple app. All you have to do is to enter country code and zippcode of places in that country and I used zippcode api but it has some restrictions like number of countries are limited you get infor in READ link in the app. 

When you submit country code and zippcode of that country you get info lik latitude longitude state, city to which submitted zipp code belongs, country and zippcode
